If you're reading this article because we've contacted you using a Pull Request, then thank you for coming this far. We hope we can convince you to give Testspace a try. It is `free` and already `setup` for you!


### Why give Testspace a try?  
First some disclosure. As a company, our history and expertise have been in the enterprise world. But now we are moving Testspace to the cloud. So to get *feedback* we decided to pursue open source. This is **why** we stage repos using Testspace and reach out with a Pull Request .. demonstrating it actually working. 

Our product works really well with GitHub and Travis. And it is really easy to use -- hey we forked your repo and added Testspace ourselves.
