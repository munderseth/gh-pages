Well how does this look? What editor would I use?

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}



Some questions:
 - Branch new posts?
 - Use a standalone editor
 - How is a Pull Request used

Lets show the `wheel`

Lots of things to consider. Lets see what will happen
